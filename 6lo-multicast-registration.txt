         IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Multicast Address Registration
              draft-thubert-6lo-multicast-registration-00

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 8505 in order to enable the registration by
   a 6LN of an IPv6 multicast address to a 6LR.  This document also
   extends RFC 9010 to enable the 6LR to inject the address in the RPL
   multicast support.

1.  Introduction

   The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally
   focused on saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of
   all.  Other design constraints, such as a limited memory capacity,
   duty cycling of the LLN devices and low-power lossy transmissions,
   derive from that primary concern.  The radio is a major energy drain
   and the protocol signaling must be adapted to optimize their
   transmissions and avoid any waste.

   The "Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks" [RFC6550]
   (RPL) to provide IPv6 [RFC8200] routing services within such
   constraints.  To save signaling and routing state in constrained
   networks, the RPL routing is only performed along a Destination-
   Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) that is optimized to reach a
   Root node, as opposed to along the shortest path between 2 peers,
   whatever that would mean in a given LLN.  This trades the quality of
   peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly reduced amount of control
   traffic and routing state that would be required to operate an any-
   to-any shortest path protocol.  Additionally, broken routes may be
   fixed lazily and on-demand, based on dataplane inconsistency
   discovery, which avoids wasting energy in the proactive repair of
   unused paths.

   The classical "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) Protocol" [RFC4861]
   [RFC4862] was defined in the late 1990's for serial links and shared
   transit media such as Ethernet where - at the time - broadcast was

   cheap and memory for neighbor cache, expensive.  It was thus designed
   as a reactive protocol that relies heavily on multicast operations
   for Address Discovery (aka Lookup) and Duplicate Address Detection
   (DAD) for IPv6 unicast addresses.  Those multicast operations
   typically impact every node on the link when at most one is really
   targeted and are especially wasteful for constrained nodes.

   The original 6LoWPAN ND, "Neighbor Discovery Optimizations for
   6LoWPAN networks" [RFC6775], was introduced to avoid the excessive
   use of multicast messages and enable IPv6 ND for operations over
   energy-constrained nodes.  [RFC6775] changes the classical IPv6 ND
   model to proactively establish the Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE)
   associated to the unicast address of a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) in the a
   6LoWPAN Router(s) (6LR) that serves it.  To that effect, [RFC6775]
   defines a new Address Registration Option (ARO) that is placed in
   unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA)
   messages between the 6LN and the 6LR.

   "Registration Extensions for 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery" [RFC8505]
   updates [RFC6775] into a generic Address Registration mechanism that
   can be used to access services such as routing and ND proxy and
   introduces the Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) for that
   purpose.  This provides a routing-agnostic interface for a host to
   request that the router injects a unicast IPv6 address in the local
   routing protocol and provide return reachability for that address.

   "Routing for RPL Leaves" [RFC9010] provides the router counterpart of
   the mechanism for a host that implements [RFC8505] to inject its
   unicast Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) and Glocal Unicast Addresses
   (GUAs).  But though RPL also provides multicast routing, [RFC8505]
   only signals unicast addresses and there is no equivalent of
   [RFC9010] to specify the 6LR operation in that case.

3.  Overview

   Figure 1 illustrates a Backbone Link that federates a collection of
   LLNs as a single IPv6 Subnet, with a number of 6BBRs providing proxy-
   ND services to their attached LLNs.

   A collection of IPv6 Nodes are present on the Backbone and use IPv6
   ND [RFC4861][RFC4862] procedures for DAD and Lookup.

   The LLN may be a hub-and-spoke access link such as (Low-Power) IEEE
   STD. 802.11 (Wi-Fi) [IEEEstd80211] and IEEE STD. 802.15.1 (Bluetooth)
   [IEEEstd802151], or a Mesh-Under or a Route-Over network [RFC8505].

   A 6LBR provides registration services for the purpose of proactive
   IPv6 ND and maintains a registry of the active registrations as an
   abstract data structure called an Address Registrar.  An entry in the
   Address Registrar is called an "Address Registration".

4.  Extending RFC 7400

   This specification defines a new capability bit for use in the 6CIO,
   as defined by [RFC7400] and extended in[RFC8505] for use in IPv6 ND
   messages.

   The new "M" bit indicates that the 6LR accepts multicast address
   registrations as specified in this document.

5.  Updating RFC 8505

   This specification does not introduce new options; it modifies
   existing options and updates the associated behaviors.

6.  Backward Compatibility

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification extends [RFC8505], and the security section of
   that document also applies to this document.  In particular, the link
   layer SHOULD be sufficiently protected to prevent rogue access.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Note to RFC Editor, to be removed: please replace "This RFC"
   throughout this document by the RFC number for this specification
   once it is allocated.

   IANA is requested to make a number of changes under the "Internet
   Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Parameters" registry, as
   follows.

8.1.  New ARO Flag

   IANA is requested to make additions to the Address Registration
   Option Status Values Registry as follows:

                +----------------+-----------+-----------+
                | ARO Status     | Meaning   | Reference |
                +----------------+-----------+-----------+
                | 11 (suggested) | Not Found | This RFC  |
                +----------------+-----------+-----------+

8.2.  New 6LoWPAN Capability Bits

   IANA is requested to make additions to the Subregistry for "6LoWPAN
   Capability Bits" as follows:

        +----------------+---------------------------+-----------+
        | Capability Bit | Meaning                   | Reference |
